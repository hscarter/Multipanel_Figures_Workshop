```

## Packages

The R packages we're going to use today are 

- readr: for reading in the data with the correct types 

- ggplot2

- ggpubr

- patchwork

- gridExtra

If you need to install these packages you can do so with the following code.

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("readr") # part of tidyverse
install.packages("ggplot2") # part of tidyverse
install.packages("ggpubr")
install.packages("patchwork")
install.packages("gridExtra")
```

Once the packages are installed they need to be added to our working library. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggpubr)
```

## Plots as objects

The following code creates a plot and displays it to the Plots window. 

```{r}
ggplot(pumpkin_data, aes(year, pumpkin_kcwt))+
  geom_col(fill = "orange")+
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Pumpkin production\n (units of 1000 hundredweight)")+
  theme_minimal()
```
